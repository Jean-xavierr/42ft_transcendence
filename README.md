## Subject

### The project

This project 42-school project is about to discover notions that we never heard about before.
The goal is to be lost in new notions to improve learning skills.

### Presentation

This is a website where you can play pong with other players.
There is accounts, a chat, spectating and a match-making system. You can also customize the game by
changing the background and add power-ups.

### Technical details

This project is fully coded in Typescript and could be deployed simply with docker-compose.

- For front framework, we choose VueJS. There are many different framework but this projet looked good to us. Above Vue, we added NuxtJS to simplify our development.
- For back framework, NestJS was imposed.
- Finally, postgres was imposed too.
